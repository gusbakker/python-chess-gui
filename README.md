# Simple Chess GUI with AI Options

## Overview
Simple Chess GUI built with Tkinter and python-chess, that serves as an interface to apply your own chess AI.

Note: To move the pieces, click on the piece, then click on the square you want to move it to.
(drag & drop would be great to implement in the future)
