# Simple Chess GUI with AI Options

## Overview
Simple Chess GUI built with Tkinter and python-chess, that serves as an interface to apply your own chess AI.
Chess rules included.

Two AI modes already included: 
- Random mode (default)
- Stockfish (installed separately).

Note: To move the pieces, click on the piece, then click on the square you want to move it to.
(drag & drop would be great to implement in the future)
